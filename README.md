**V2.0.20230501: 10th Anniversary "Remastered" Edition**

![Screenshot: Armor Alley, 2023 update, running in a full-screen browser tab. Game menu, Helicopter, battlefield and ground units are displayed.](image/armor-alley_game_image_1920x1080.jpg)

Previous release: V1.5.20220201. Original release: V1.0.20131031.

**Video overview**
---
• 10th Anniversary summary video (3m 45s): https://youtu.be/oYUCUvg02rY

**New features**
---
* **Mobile / touch screen support**. Updated UX / UI, better playability and feature parity vs. desktop. Portrait is playable, but landscape is preferable on smaller screens.

* **Network multiplayer**, like the original game. PvP, or co-op. Can be played with or against CPU players, as well.

* **22 game levels.** 10 original game "campaign" battles, plus 12 levels designed for network games.

* **Level editor**. Create or modify existing levels. Data stored in URL at present - terrible, I know. Also compatible with network games.

* Optional **"Virtual Stupidity"** theme pack. 🎸🤘

## Performance improvements
---

• Reduced CPU load, in general, across the board between JavaScript execution, layout, and paint / compositing.

• Game Loop: Adjustments to target 30FPS on 120 Hz monitors. [01f9f43](commit/01f9f435424c6b61f8765b13dd52504cd9b3d397)

• Collision "zones", greatly reducing object comparison work and function calls. 20,000 collision checks per second, down to 500 or less. https://twitter.com/schill/status/1627725917345955840

• DOM node pool / recycling: `poolBoy.js` - for things like gunfire and smoke. Less paint / repaint, more GPU compositing. https://twitter.com/schill/status/1628833430988554240

• Reduced variable / object creation in game loop.

• Battlefield DOM node no longer being transformed for scroll; now, only on-screen sprites.

## Sound
---

• Even more sound effects.

• Some sounds can use ±5% playback speed for a little variety.

• Sounds can now be heard "in the distance," to the left and right.

• "Virtual Stupidity": 500+ meticulously-picked samples. [21f7726](commit/21f7726acde0b03b251e589963e1dde556566a74)

## UX / UI
---
• "Live Graveyard" feature: decorate the battlefield over time. [032f845](commit/032f8459321ea61a73421450be44d7c4340a9e66)

• "Remastered" 8-bit sprite assets from Armor Alley V1.1 for Macintosh. The original 1.0 and PC-DOS version had up to 4-bit colour.

• Nice home page logo, "scanned" from the combat handbook that came with the original boxed game.

• Network games use Windows 95's `LIGHTS.EXE` taskbar UI showing tx/rx traffic, very important. ;) https://twitter.com/schill/status/1636449071140605958 [17c0a9b](commit/17c0a9b4a2deb1770281b84842ee1c4f56412bf6)

• Four types of stormy weather: rain, hail, snow, and one other that's a surprise.

• Radar jamming: New visual noise overlay.

"Extra-fancy" bunker explosions, particles, burning, and smoke effects.

• Nicer bomb explosion on ground. Hat tip: "Dirt Explosion" by SrGrafo on DeviantArt - https://www.deviantart.com/srgrafo/art/Dirt-Explosion-774442026

• "DOMFetti" confetti explosions, colours based on the target being hit.

• Notifications: Verbiage for different actions, e.g., "your tank steamrolled an infantry", or gunfire "popped a balloon" etc.

## Bug fixes
---

• Refactor of Traffic Control, so vehicles are less likely to get "stuck" waiting for one another.

• Helicopter bombs could be delayed after key press. They should now be consistent and fire on the next frame.

• Super Bunkers would sometimes stay yellow, even when friendly.

• Additional "arrow signs" on battlefield were missing from bases since 2013. Oops. ;)

• Parachute infantry (dropped from helicopter) no longer get a recycle (reaching end of battlefield) reward.

• Balloon respawning at top of screen: fixed.

• Allow balloons to be moving up or down at init, previously always downward.

• Fixed bomb spark / hidden / bottom-align logic.

• Tighten up inventory ordering / queueing, consistent spacing + avoiding overlapping between sprites.

## Gameplay
---

**Helicopters**

• Only the local player's helicopter blinks on the radar; all others are solid, as in the original game.

• Desktop: double-click no longer toggles helicopter auto-rotate feature.

**Smart Missiles**

• Notify user when trying to fire a smart missile, but no eligible targets nearby.

• Smart missiles can now take damage, and plow through up to four infantry (ground units only) before dying.

• Smart Missile targeting refactor. Removed former "missile facing target" requirement. Prefer shortest distance, unless just above ground. Hat tip: Pythagoras. :wink: :triangular_ruler:

• Smart Missiles now target your vertical offset, plus half your height.

• Smart Missiles now blink on launch, and take a moment (0.5 seconds) to arm themselves, and are not as dangerous (1 damage point) until then. This is implemented as the "Ramius frame count" (delay) [1d71faf](commit/1d71faf5dd66b38dad93e17aba9242a9b228a220) - as inspired by "The Hunt For Red October." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgTc3cYaLdo&t=112s

• New feature: Smart Missile "decoy" ability, - about 1/3 of a second to see and retarget a newly-deployed parachute infantry when the initial target was the helicopter. [926b16f](commit/926b16f262a9a45a91e75a5dfebbdb73bb457b49)

**Gunfire**

• Gunfire can now collide with gunfire.

• Turret gun firing rates have been reduced significantly for easy + hard levels.

• Gunfire can now ricochet off the roof of a Super Bunker.

• Desktop: Helicopter gunfire now stops when landing on, and cannot start while on a landing pad.

**Bombs**

• Bombs now "pass-thru" infantry, as opposed to dying 1:1.

• Bomb explosions on the ground can now take out larger groups of infantry.

• Bombs can be hit by gunfire in extreme mode.

**Tanks**

• Tanks have finally been given flamethrowsers (as in the original game,) which they use on infantry, engineers, super bunkers and end bunkers. [e3de57e](commit/e3de57e8c1aa009c09c0c67f424515a5f1e178e8)

• Game preferences refactor. Volume control, UX/UI, and optional gameplay features.

• Enemy tanks fire every 11 frames in "hard" mode, 12 in "easy" (and tutorial), and 10 in "extreme." Previously, all were 10.

• Tanks now repair more incrementally, larger gains every 1 second.

**Other**

• Engineers start repairing bunkers (if enabled) at the doorway, "shielded" by bunker vs. previously standing outside.

• Landing pads can be "The Danger Zone" if enabled in prefs. This was inspired by the 2022 Top Gun movie release. See also: "The Girl From Ipanema, "I Got You Babe," "Mucha Muchacha," and more.

• Base explosions can now also damage units passing by.

• Bases can fire rubber chickens + bananas if "match missile type" enabled in prefs.

• "GOURANGA!" - inspired by the original Grand Theft Auto.

• When the battle is over, the losing team's units all contribute to the explosion party.

## Technical
---

• Codebase migration to ES6 modules, patterns and syntax.

• SoundManager 2: hacked-together version of Web Audio API for playback, vs. HTML5. [a44bc81](commit/a44bc81b53dc5fd2b7f8219abec6278af05b746c)

• Refactoring of game type and objects system; e.g., `tank` -> `TYPES.tank`, and `game.objects.tanks[]` -> `game.objects.tank[]` so look-ups and interating by type are logical.

• `game.objects.players` now has local, remote, cpu etc., which point to helicopters. Previously, many assumptions were made about `game.objects.helicopters[0]` and `[1]`.

• Network feature uses [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) (MIT license) for peer-to-peer communication via WebRTC.

## Miscellaneous
---

• It turns out there are _three_ types of cloud sprites in the original game, not two. [4a561c4](commit/4a561c4fac6efb7f85b8831710b228bd1a750eaa)

• 12 smoke frames in the original game too, vs. my 9. [53f08aa](commit/53f08aab45b76d4c4975e3d8c7c02d433eba7aeb)

• Nicer ASCII block-character logo.

• Updated favicon + related app / tile images.

**Video overview**

 * Demo, features and walk-through of "extreme" mode (55 minutes): https://youtu.be/9BQ62c7u2JM 

**Performance improvements**

 • The game should be smoother, targeting 30FPS. It is OK full-screen @ 1080p and windowed @ 4K in Chrome on a 2018 Mac Mini, 3.2 GHz 6-core i7 w/Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB.

 • More GPU-accelerated rendering, reduced DOM nodes by removing when off-screen (e.g., static terrain items)

 • All sprites should be on the GPU and moved using transforms, reducing paint operations

 • All transforms (CSS + JS) for positioning + animation are 3d, with the goal of GPU acceleration - e.g., translate3d(), rotate3d(), scale3d()

 • DOM nodes are not appended at object create time - now deferred until the object is on-screen for the first time.

 • All "sub-sprites" should now be GPU-accelerated via CSS animations, transforms and transitions

 • Sound: Only create `Audio()` when actively playing sounds, and destroy when they finish playing. Browsers are starting to limit the number of `Audio()` instances.

 • Sound: Queue and play sounds all at once with each animation frame callback, vs. prior ad-hoc behaviour.

 • Refactored game tip scroller to only show two nodes at a time, 1024px width vs. 102,400px. Front-end tech / Chrome Dev Tools demo: https://youtu.be/eVW0WgTdK3A

 • Performance: Don't update known static radar items: turret, base, bunkers (bunker, end bunker, super bunker) unless marked as "stale" during resize / world scaling

 • Performance: CSS / `contentVisibility` to reduce / optimize rendering costs

 • Animation loop: improved timing, target 30 fps. Request next frame right away. Exit early if next frame arrives too quickly.

 • Turret "scan" is now a CSS animation; previously, animated via JS.

 • Smart missiles and helicopter trailers are now GPU-accelerated.

 • Performance: Battlefield and radar units are now positioned via transform: translate3d() - no more legacy CSS shenanigans using `bottom: 0px`.

 • Memory leak fixes: DOM nodes, audio events, and a few others.

**Sound**

 • Over 100 sound assets now in use

 • New and updated sound effects: Infantry and engineer gunfire, injury and death, credit +/-, helicopter and turret guns, shell casings on turrets,
bullets hitting the ground, turret being disabled and enabled (restored.)

**UX / UI**

 • Proper "game options" modal with radio buttons and checkboxes for various UX/UI and gameplay features

 • "It was a dark and stormy night" - option for snow on the battlefield. (May be slow on some computers.)

 • Bunkers, balloons and super-bunkers now use graphics from the Macintosh (68K) version of Armor Alley; a bit more orange, and less garish yellow.

 • Dune ][-style credit / debit UI and sounds

 • Toast-style game notifications

 • Health status bars when units are being hit or repaired

 • New and improved smoke / particle effects, more explosions and shrapnel, more fun!

 • Order queue: Refactored UI to show letters (e.g., MTVIE), with superscript numbers as appropriate.

 • Missiles smoke more, and in extreme mode, have a burst of thrust (as in the original game) as they near expiry

 • Pseudo-3D effect on shrapnel: Increase size slightly with vertical position on screen

 • Ground units are "behind" most terrain elements like trees, bushes etc.

**Bug fixes**

 • Bombing floating balloons no longer causes an explosion on the ground

 • Improved bomb and shrapnel alignment / collision positioning with balloons, tanks, bunkers, and super-bunkers

 • Fixed bug with quickly-respawning balloons (shooting balloon while infantry are passing under bunker, for example.)

 • Fixed UI bug where the "incoming missile" white line would not always disappear.

 • Game end: Improve alignment of view and base

 • Adjusted initial position of game, centering view on the helicopter + base

 • Helicopter / super-bunker: Improve vertical alignment if helicopter crashes on superbunker "roof."

 • Fixed radar item for Super Bunkers, now shows correct friendly / enemy status.

 • Cloud "wind" accelerates / decelerates more smoothly

 • Clouds no longer "bounce" when they drift off the end of the world, but get a nice bit of wind to bring them back into view.

 • Slight vertical alignment tweaks on gunfire and balloons in radar view.

 • Improved orientation of heat-seeking smart missiles (and rubber chickens and bananas) as they track their target

 • Tweaked movement and velocity of smart missiles, making them potentially faster / more random

 • Enemy helicopter will now turn to face targets. Sometimes it would fire the other way. ;)

 • Improved helicopter motion when approaching landing pad - "bounce" has largely been eliminated.

 • Improved off-screen / on-screen DOM pruning, restoration of 3D transforms when re-appending DOM elements

 • Fixed end-game bug, sometimes ground units (e.g. van) did not appear at base when blowing up.

 • Adjusted collision detection: if helicopter is hiding "in" a friendly super-bunker, bombs should hit the roof of the super bunker and not the helicopter.

**Gameplay**

 • New weapon: Heat-seeking bananas

 • Ground unit "Traffic Control" option: Vehicles try to leave space between, and avoid overlapping each other. Tanks will now "park" behind friendly tanks, avoiding a pile-up. Tanks normally only stop to fire. Vans and missile launchers will now wait for each other, too. Tanks will not stop for vans or missile launchers, giving tanks a greater chance of ending up at the front of a convoy - a preferable offensive position.

 • Units can now be "recycled" if they cross the battlefield, you are rewarded 2x cost in credits

 • Engineers can now steal all funds from enemy bunker

 • Engineers can now repair (but not rebuid) friendly bunkers

 • Bullets now ricochet off non-friendly super-bunkers

 • Shrapnel will ricochet off certain units (tank, super-bunker)

 • "Incoming missile" doesn't show in extreme mode when the radar is jammed.

 • End base, extreme mode: if a defense missile is destroyed, respawn another within 0.5 seconds.

 • Missile launchers trigger when closer to the helicopter, more likely now to be on-screen

 • Helicopter respawn: Delay if certain ground units are obstructing the landing pad.

 • Enemy helicopter AI: Default 10% of dropping bombs when targeting a tank, subject to game difficulty (hard: 15%, extreme: 25%.)

 • Bombs can now collide with smart missiles and take them out

 • Tank gunfire only hits bunkers if tanks are shooting at a helicopter, or another tank (bug fix: previously, tanks could destroy a bunker trying to hit an infantry on the other side.)

 • Super bunkers that are un-manned are "neutral" and dangerous to both sides, and will be shown as hostile on the radar. (This includes when tanks disarm a bunker by firing at it.)

 • Bomb trajectory now includes the helicopter's Y-axis velocity, and they now rotate along with their trajectory.

 • Helicopters now rise up from the landing pad on game start and respawn, like the original game.

 • Helicopter gunfire takes tilt / angle into account.

 • Helicopter "shake" starts when health is under 70%, gets worse with damage. This affects gunfire trajectory.

 • Your missile launchers only fire at the enemy helicopter when the convoy is "unassisted", e.g., there is no friendly helicopter or turret nearby.

 • Extreme mode: If you shoot down the enemy base's smart missiles while near the base, it will launch new ones that are faster and more difficult to dodge.

 • While on a landing pad, your gunfire may go over infantry's heads most of the time.

 • Don't assume the top of the battlefield is always safe; watch out for balloons!

 • Parachute infantry now fall at slightly different rates, and may be affected more by wind

 • A few additional, inspirational [ game paused in background ] messages

**Technical notes: development / code**

 • Migrated core JavaScript to ES6 syntax, retaining functional + prototypal inheritance style. Slightly less verbose.

 • As part of ES6 migration, dropped legacy IE 8 + 9 code and checks: ancient event handlers, lack of transform, `requestAnimationFrame()` polyfill etc.

 • Lots of cleanup: Exit early, reduced `if/else` nesting. Dropped all `setTimeout()` calls, moved to a frame-based approach: `setFrameTimeout()`.

 • `aa.js` (core game code) is massive at ~450 KB, and seems like a good candidate to be broken up into ES6 modules. TBD.

### V1.51.20181124

**Performance tweaks**

 • More motion / animation is now on the GPU via `transform`, vs. `style.left` / `style.top`.

 • Main animation loop calls `requestAnimationFrame()` first, before anything else (like VSYNC.)

 • Drop legacy SM2 flash options.

 • Turret scan is now driven by CSS animation vs. JS setting an angle transform every frame.

**Sound**

 • New base explosion, tweaked other explosion sound effects.

 • New "heavy mechanics" bunker chain (repair) sound.

### V1.5.20180201

**Big feature updates!**

 • Game "mostly" now works on mobile devices. Touch-based events for helicopter control, UI for helicopter weapons and inventory / ordering. Tested on iPhone X. Others should work reasonably-well. Hopefully.

 • Inventory order queueing! 🎉 (Finally.) e.g., 3 tanks in a row. Queueing deducts funds immediately. No added UI or cancel ability (yet.)

 • Battlefield view is now bigger on screen. Stats UI is dead, long live stats.
  
 • Performance improvements. tl;dr: JavaScript tweaks, putting most all sprites onto the GPU. Replaced most common animated .GIF backgrounds with 3d-transform, GPU-accelerated CSS animation-driven sprites. 😅

**Sound**
 
 • No sound for any Safari (desktop or mobile) for now, including version 11.0. Multiple sounds kill performance on desktop, and "auto-play" is effectively blocked on mobile. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116145

 • New + improved helicopter machine gun sounds. 9 different samples, played at random.

 • New sound effects: "bomb hatch" (helicopter bomb release), tank gunfire, bunker chain/balloon repair, helicopter gunfire hit.

 • "Medals clanking" sound for bunker chain/balloon repair. (BY-NC 3.0.) https://freesound.org/people/Gareth_H/sounds/365799/

 • New tank gunfire sound: "Tank Fire Mixed.wav" by Cyberkineticfilms/freesound.org (CC0, "No Rights Reserved". 🙇)

 • Hat tip: "Bolo" "tank self hit" sound effect, Copyright (C) Steuart Cheshire 1993. My favourite Mac game of all time. ❤️

**UX / UI**
  
 • "Radar jammed" TV static-like overlay with transform sprite.

 • Parachute infantry swing in the air thanks to CSS animations, and move more smoothly when the wind picks up.

 • Jam radar all the time when an enemy van is within range on hard + extreme game types. (previously, jamming could switch on/off at random intervals.)

 • Slightly faster helicopter bombing rate - more responsive.
  
 • Chain refactor. Use fixed height, animate via transform, fall with gravity when balloon and/or bunker are lost.

 • Balloons are yellow-ish on radar, and now transform-rotated to elliptical shapes. Bunkers / base color and border tweaks, friendly vs. enemy now look different.

 • Inventory and helicopter ammo, etc., become greyed out when unaffordable / unavailable.

 • Target / "tracking" animation on Smart Missile targets.

 • Smart Missiles can now re-target on the next frame after the original target dies. If a new target can not be immediately acquired, the Smart Missile dies as previously.

 • Radar items, clouds and some other sprites move more smoothly simply by dropping `parseInt()`.

 • "C" / rubber chicken use causes UI to switch to rubber chicken mode.

 • Possible bugfix: If paused and enemy order timer fires, re-start timer. This probably fixes enemy inventory building sometimes breaking.


**Miscellany**

 • Note re: Firefox `will-change` memory consumption warning that might show in console.

 • URL feature flags: `noTranslate3d` and `noRadarGPU`. `frameRate=[60|*]` for testing of `requestAnimationFrame()` timing. camelCase others. Let Opera (now webkit-based) have transforms.

 • +`makeTransformSprite()`, a sort of sub-sprite for CSS transform-based animations (GPU-accelerated animated .GIF alternatives.)

 • `z-index: -1` can be harmful for performance / compositing.

 • iPhone X notch handling based on orientation and whatnot.
